            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>
                My dad moved to Goshen in 2000 when the RV industry was really booming, and my mom came shortly after. 
                I was almost 15 then. At that age, it was really hard to move from another country. I missed a lot of 
                my friends and I didn’t know any English at all. At that time, I met now-current band member Sonny Carreño 
                through Goshen Community Schools’ ENL program. Sonny and Mr. Prieto started teaching me English. Sonny and 
                I bonded over The Beatles, probably my all-time favorite band. Music helped with the difficulties and frustrations 
                of the language barrier. I didn’t have a ton of friends and couldn’t get to as many places with public transit so I 
                focused a lot on my instrument. I played pretty much every day and usually for hours.
                <br>
                I’ve never had any other career goals than being a musician when I grew up. My dad is a musician 
                and my grandpa on my mom’s side is a Mariachi musician. I was mesmerized by them. Playing with them, 
                watching them play – It was super fascinating to watch them jump from instrument to instrument. It’s funny 
                but I didn’t even know that my dad was a musician because he worked all the time. But then people started 
                putting pictures of him on Facebook being in a rock n’ roll band.
                <br>
                When you come from another country to the U.S., you see a lot of things in the media that you fear are true. 
                But Goshen is this little place in the middle that isn’t like that. Goshen has this shield of awesomeness. I 
                attribute a lot to Goshen College for being welcoming to everyone from wherever they are.
